This file is to test branching in Git

To push the file to the remote repository, but on a new branch (not main)
the command IS NOT 'git push --origin 'branch_name'
the CORRECT command is 'git push origin <branch_name>'

Now I am testing how the log looks like, when I detach the HEAD from any branch and attach it to a commit:

    1. when HEAD points to the branch AnotherBranch:
    dci-student@dciadmin-ThinkPad-L15-Gen-4:~/exercises/005-20240516/my_exersice_repo$ git log --pretty=oneline --graph

* 600ade138b2e90e19c1603c1be6780e66e277842 Initial commit

    (2. committed 'test_text.txt' to AnotherBranch)

    3. making HEAD point to the commit:
    git log --pretty=format:"%h:  %d" -1
    # 4d6261b:  (HEAD -> AnotherBranch) (this is what the terminal shows when using the command above)

    git checkout 4d6261b -q # (-q is for dramatic effect)
    git log --pretty=format:"%h:  %d" -1   
    # 4d6261b:   (HEAD, master)

    3. commit 'test_text.txt':
    git add test_text.txt
    git status
    # HEAD detached at 4d6261b
    # Changes to be committed:
    # (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
    #     modified:   test_text.txt
    git commit -m "committing with HEAD point to commit"

    4. check out log again and see how it looks now
    it log --pretty=oneline --graph
* b37b0d3d9594b64ee160445ffecdf7b5abf8f6ea (HEAD) committing with HEAD point to commit

--> HEAD moved up, but without the branch
it is not possible to 'push' when not attached to a branch:
git push
# fatal: You are not currently on a branch.
# To push the history leading to the current (detached HEAD)
# state now, use
#
#     git push origin HEAD:<name-of-remote-branch>
