This file is to test branching in Git

To push the file to the remote repository, but on a new branch (not main)
the command IS NOT 'git push --origin 'branch_name'
the CORRECT command is 'git push origin <branch_name>'

Now I am testting how it looks like, when I detach the HEAD from any branch and attach it to a commit:
    (this file (test_text.txt) has been comitted in the branch 'AnotherBranch')
    git log --pretty=format:"%h:  %d" -1
    # a3c485d:   (HEAD -> master)

    git checkout a3c485d -q # (-q is for dramatic effect)
    git log --pretty=format:"%h:  %d" -1   
    # a3c485d:   (HEAD, master)
